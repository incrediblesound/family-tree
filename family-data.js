    name: 'Baron Lucas Gottneb of Voltzgrad',
    life: '1412-1457',
    history: 'Baron Gottneb ruled the kingdom of Voltzgrad from birth till death. He is the first\
    Gottneb of which there are any records. He lived in a manor situated on the edge of a large hunting\
    park that was surrounded on three sides by mountains. He was a kind ruler, according to all\
    contemporary references, of which there are but few. He was recorded to have provided grain\
    to the people during the great famine of 1431, and held an open banquet for the kindgom on the day\
    of his wedding. He married Cecilia of Weinsolft in the spring of 1433, and subsequently minted coins\
    in the name of "Lucas and Cecilia, Baron and Baroness of Voltzgrad". They had seven children during their\
    twenty four years of marriage, but only three survived childhood. The Baron was fond of hunting\
    and of breeding dogs. Some say the decline of the house of Gottned began in the summer of 1448 when\
    a pack of dogs mysteriously escaped their kennel and devoured his seventh child while he was playing\
    in the gardens. The Baron subsequently had all the dogs killed. The killing of the dogs was done hastily\
    and was overheard by Cecilia. Cecilia was unable to drive the sound of the massacre from her mind and it slowly drove her mad.\
    She threw herself out of a tower window by that winter.'

    name: 'Cecilia Gottneb of Voltzgrad',
    life: '1422-1448',
    history: 'The early history of Cecilia Gottneb is unknown. She most likely came from the royal family\
    of Weinsolft, for it is in this way that political alliances were formed in that time period. She was\
    well educated in Latin and Greek, and there are a few volumes of hers that are still preserved in the Voltzgrad\
    museum. The death of four of her children during her marriage with Lucas took a heavy toll on her heart.\
    In the later years of her life, and she was known to stay up very late reading. In fact, they were tales of\
    ghost in the manor that would roam the halls at midnight in a white dress. In reality it was probably just\
    cecilia, who wandered the manor aimlessly in her sleepless depression. Her gloom finally came to an end in\
    1448 when she killed herself after the death of her sevent child.'

    gen: 'b1', 
    name:'Baron Edgar Gottneb of Voltzgrad',
    life: '1434-1478',
    history:'Edgar Gottned was a prodigal child. Under the tutelage of his father and of the great logician\
    Abelgrad, his private tutor, Edgar made great accomplishments in poetry, mathematics and astronomy by\
    the time he was thirteen. Scandal struck early, however, when it was discovered that he had been sneaking\
    into a nearby village and having an affair with a farm girl when he was just fifteen. He was severely\
    disciplined by his father, after which he did not leave Gottned manor for at least three years. After his\
    fathers death Franz became obsessed with music. He had an Italian harpsicord brought to the manor and\
    placed in one of the minor halls. This period of time was considered the last golden era of the Gottnebs.\
    Musicians came frequently to the manor, and Edgar and his wife hosted regular salons for poets, composers\
    and philosophers. It is said that one day Edgar went on a fishing excursion and when he returned did not\
    speak for ten days. After this time he became increasingly reclusive, and some say he had a secret laboratory\
    in the basement of the manor where he conducted alchemical experiments. In (????) he comisssioned the\
    construction of an organ in the chapel of the Manor with a row of pipes that would produce the sound of\
    a human choir. The experiment went terribly wrong, however, and the pipes produced a raspy sound\
    somewhat akin to human screams, but with a slightly more animal character. Edgar had the engineer killed.\
    It is said he spent the rest of his life attempting to compose an organ piece which he never finished,\
    but evidence of such a work was never found.'

    name: 'Catherine Gottneb',
    life: '',
    history: 'Catherine Gottneb, wife of Edgar Gottneb was a woman beloved by all who knew her. She came from\
    the local nobility and was well educated at a young age. It was said that her only flaw was her husband,\
    who had a reputation for mental instability. It never upset her, or at least she never showed any discontentment, and always maintained regal poise. After her death if was\
    revealed that she had an unusual passion for surgery. She had arranged to have private doctor seretly bring\
    cadavers to Gottned manor for her to study. Other historians have suggested that this fact could explain\
    some of the more fantastic rumors about her husband\'s experiments.'

    name: 'Baron Edgar Gottneb II of Voltzgrad',
    life: '',
    history:'Edgar Gottneb was extremely stern even as a young boy. He was tall and slim, with a narrow face and a piercing gaze that never seemed to change into a smile.\
    In his early years he spent much of his time\
    with an old nun who was his tutor, and later on frequently attended the criminal court of the kingdom. It was\
    said that he had an interest in law, but the events of his life suggest that this was misinformation spread\
    by the Gottneb family in order to protect their son. In reality, Edgar Gottneb was interested in crime.\
    He became a military general in (????) and was known for his ruthlessness both toward the enemy and his own\
    troops. He was liberal in dispensing punishments, to say the least. He had perhaps the worst reputation\
    of all the Gottnebs despite his rather ordinary life considering who he was and the time he lived. The last\
    straw fell when he had a peasant drawn and quartered for a minor trade violation. After that he was dragged\
    from the manor and burned alive by an angry mob.'
